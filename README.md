# Bookly

## About the project
This application is developed using Angular Framework, and is based on the APIs provided by Open Library.
It should consist of a simple textbox to allow the user to search for all books in a specific category.
When the user click on a specific button, the application will have to contact the Api and will appear a list of book card with only the title and the list of authors.
This book card will contain a specific button, which if clicked you will see the book description.
